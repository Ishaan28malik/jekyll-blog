Head south for dry heat and try to avoid the tropical north from December to February as it is the wet season with lots of rain, storms and sticky humid conditions.Autumn to winter (April to September) is a very pleasant time of year to explore the northern and central parts of Australia because of clear warm days and cool nights. You’ll find a little more rain in the south of the country but on average you’ll still get more sunshine. It does snow during the winter months but this is totally confined to the mountains in the south east of the country.</h3></p>

**Getting There** 

A large number of major and budget airlines fly direct to capital cities such as Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane from New Zealand, the Pacific Islands, Asia and parts of the US and the Middle East. If you are travelling from further afield, you’ll easily be able to find connecting flights through major hubs in Asia, the Middle East and west coast USA.Remember, Australia a long way from most other parts of the world. It takes almost 20+ hours (with a short stopover) to get from the UK and Europe, and 14+ hours from the US. Asia is a little closer with Singapore and Bangkok about 8 hours away.I use and recommend for researching and booking flights all around the world.

**Getting Around**


Australia is a big country. Bigger than most people actually realise. To give you an idea, if you were to drive from Sydney on the east coast to Perth on the west coast it would take you something like 40 hours without stopping. That is 4,000 kilometres! The same route by air would take you 4 hours

#### **Flying**

If you are wanting to cover as much of the country as possible in a short time then flying will be the most efficient method of getting around but it will likely cost you a bit too. While Australia does have budget airlines, they don’t offer the crazy low prices quite like other parts of the world so a bit of research and planning is required to do this on the cheap.

Australia’s major air carrier is Qantas who service every capital city and major rural hub. Catching up with Qantas on popularity is the once budget airline Virgin Australia. They fly between all capital cities and a few of the major hubs as well and offer pricing that is comparative to Qantas, sometimes a little cheaper.

Australia’s budget airlines are Jetstar (part of Qantas) and TigerAir. They both offer lower fares with a budget service, so no meals and you pay extra for carry-on luggage, extra leg-room and entertainment. If your flying regional then it will likely be with REX or one of the many other small regional airlines specific to each region.
