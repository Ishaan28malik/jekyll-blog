Head south for dry heat and try to avoid the tropical north from December to February as it is the wet season with lots of rain, storms and sticky humid conditions.Autumn to winter (April to September) is a very pleasant time of year to explore the northern and central parts of Australia because of clear warm days and cool nights. You’ll find a little more rain in the south of the country but on average you’ll still get more sunshine. It does snow during the winter months but this is totally confined to the mountains in the south east of the country.
