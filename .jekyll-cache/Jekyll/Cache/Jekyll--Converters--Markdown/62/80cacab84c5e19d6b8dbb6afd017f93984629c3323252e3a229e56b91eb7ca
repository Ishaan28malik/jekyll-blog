Bali is a budget backpacker paradise. It’s one of the most popular destinations in [Indonesia](https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-guides/indonesia-travel-tips/) and a hub for travelers, yoga lovers, honeymooners, and digital nomads alike.

Not only does it cater to the budget-savvy vagabond, but the island offers plenty of options for the more affluent traveler as well.

While visiting Bali has become cliched these days with some many people trying to find their “Eat, Pray, Love” experience and chill out at some expensive yoga retreat, I still find the island to be beautiful, budget friendly, and full of things to do. The countryside is beautiful, the beaches (outside of Kuta) are picture perfect, there is great hiking, friendly locals, world-class dining, and it’s inexpensive.

I spent a month exploring the island and would happily go back and explore it again.

The trick to traveling Bali is to get away from Ubud and Kuta. Once you do so, you’ll find a much calmer, cheaper, and less-busy island worth exploring where the touts don’t bother you and the empty beaches are yours to enjoy.

This travel guide to Bali will show you how to make the most of your visit, save money, get off the beaten path and away from the crowds, and have the trip of a lifetime.

<h5 id="1-try-some-adventure-sports">1. Try some adventure sports</h5>

<p>There are tons of adventurous activities to do. You can go paragliding, hiking, mountain cycling, horseback riding, jungle trekking, and even treetop zip-lining. Prices will vary, though they are all quite affordable. Paragliding, for example, will cost you around 1,500,000 IDR ($110 USD) per person for a tandem glide.</p>

<h5 id="2-scuba-diving-and-snorkeling">2. Scuba diving and snorkeling</h5>

<p>While snorkeling is always an option here, Bali is most popular for its phenomenal dive spots. The reefs here are beautiful and there is an amazing variety of fish to see. The wreck of a US cargo ship, Liberty, is a highly recommended spot. Prices will vary but expect to pay at least 1,900,000 IDR ($135 USD) for a two-tank dive.</p>

<h5 id="3-visit-the-spa">3. Visit the spa</h5>

<p>Bali is the perfect place to re-energize by pampering yourself and releasing bottled up stress and tension. Balinese massage is one of the most relaxing in the world, and there are a number of Balinese spa treatments which involve the use of various herbs and spices. Prices vary depending on what you purchase but expect to pay at least 275,000 IDR ($20 USD) for a treatment.</p>

<h5 id="4-party-in-kuta">4. Party in Kuta</h5>

<p>Kuta is kind of like the Tijuana of Bali. The streets are narrow here and there are hundreds of stalls selling faux-brand ripoffs and novelty souvenirs. There are plenty of hostels and lots of bars that cater to the younger backpacker crowd. If you’re looking to party, this is the best spot on the island to do so. <a href="https://www.nomadicmatt.com/travel-blogs/the-saturday-city-kuta/">Personally, I hate Kuta</a> and think there are a lot of better places on the island.</p>

<h5 id="5-go-dolphin-watching">5. Go dolphin watching</h5>

<p>There are various companies that offer sunrise boat trips — and you are likely to hear about them at every hotel you stay in. It’s about a two-hour excursion and it’s best to get a ticket the day before. Expect to pay around 800,000 IDR ($57 USD) for adults and 560,000 IDR ($40 USD) for kids.</p>

<h5 id="6-watch-the-monkeys">6. Watch the monkeys</h5>

<p>In Ubud, you can also visit the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaKduQOog3U">Ubud Monkey Forest</a>, a nature reserve and sacred area with temples. It’s very touristy, and a lot of people break the rules and feed the monkeys, which teaches them bad habits so don’t do that! Still, it’s exciting to watch all of the long-tailed macaques running around and playing with each other. Admission is 80,000 IDR ($5.50 USD) for adults.</p>

<h5 id="7-watch-a-buffalo-race">7. Watch a Buffalo Race</h5>

<p>Chances are, after a few days in Bali, you will have seen the water buffalo working in the various fields. In Negara, locals riding chariots race buffaloes every second Sunday from July to October. Negara is a bit out of the way and the races take place at 7am, so you probably should arrange accommodation for the night before.</p>
